Hi there! I am Saurav.

I am a product-led solution architect and software engineer, currently into developing AI agents and multi-agent systems for every day enterprise problems and productivity. Building mostly on Python, Java and OpenAI.

I write here on my learnings and opinionated views on agentic AI and software engineering in general.
