title:  "Building an MCP server and configuring with the Claude desktop app"
excerpt: "MCP is an open standard that promises to glue LLMs with tools and services, often called the USB-C of AI applications. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP standardizes these interactions."

[All about MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). 

In this post I show how to create a simple MCP server and connect it with the Claude Desktop App (MCP client). [Download here](https://claude.ai/download).

Let's assume we are developing a conversation interface for a hotel, where visitors can have a conversation with an chatbot and book a hotel. Let's also assume the chatbot is Claude Sonnet or any of Anthropic's LLMs, served via this desktop app, which is our MCP client as well.

However, the LLM doesn't know anything about the hotel's internal processes and business information, like what rooms the hotel has, prices, amenities, etc. 

But what the hotel has, is its own enterprise software (like a reservation management system), which does all of that. Our job is to expose chosen functionalities as `tools` for the LLM, that the MCP client can help the LLM use, and facilitate the conversation with the visitors.

### ✅ Setup

Install `uv` as shown here: [UV documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### ✅ Create your workspace and open in vscode or any editor of your choice.

`cd` into the workspace and run:

```powershell
uv init HotelBookingMcp
uv venv .venv

.venv/Scripts/activate

uv add "mcp[cli]"

```

A simple `JSON` based in-memory data-structure in Python defining the hotel database as:

```python
# File: data/db.py

hotel_database = {
    "hotel_name": "Grand Hotel",
    "location": "123 Main St, Springfield, USA",
    "currency": "USD",
    "standard_amenities": ["breakfast", "free Wi-Fi"],
    "luxury_amenities": ["spa", "pool", "gym", "spa", ],
    "suite_amenities": ["private balcony", "ocean view"],
    "rooms": {
        "101": {
            "type": "standard",
            "price_per_night": 100.00,
            "available": True,
            "occupied_by": None,
        },
        "102": {
            "type": "standard",
            "price_per_night": 100.00,

        },
        "201": {
            "type": "luxury",
            "price_per_night": 150.00,
            "available": True,
            "occupied_by": None,
        },
        "202": {
            "type": "luxury",
            "price_per_night": 150.00,
            "available": True,
            "occupied_by": None,
        },
        "301": {
            "type": "suite",
            "price_per_night": 200.00,
            "available": True,
            "occupied_by": None,
        },
        "302": {
            "type": "suite",
            "price_per_night": 200.00,
            "available": True,
            "occupied_by": None,
        }        
    }

✅ Note the `@mcp.tool()` decorator. <br />
✅ Every tool function must begin with docstrings. This helps the LLM understand which tool does what! *Very important!*

Creating the server:

```python
# File: server.py

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Hotel Booking MCP Server")

```

Creating the entrypoint:

```python
# File: main.py

from server import mcp

# following import statements are necessary for the MCP server to recognize the tools
from tools.tools import (
    get_hotel_info,
    get_available_rooms,
    get_amenities,
    book_room_by_room_number,
    book_room_by_type,
    get_booking_details,
    count_available_rooms_by_type,
    get_room_price_by_type
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
    
```

Your workspace should look like:

```text
workspace
  .venv
  data
    db.py
  utils
    utils.py
  tools
    tools.py
  server.py
  main.py

```

<hr />

The `mcp.run(transport="stdio")` in `main.py` indicates that the MCP server is running in the same host the client (in this case Claude Desktop App) is running.

# Claude desktop config to attach MCP server

Open Claude desktop app:

`File` ➡️ `Settings` ➡️ `Developer`

Edit config to edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.

On Windows, this file lives in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Claude` directory.

⚠️ Copy-paste and modify one of the following configs in the `claude_desktop_config.json` file as required.

### ✅ Claude config for `stdio`

This is when the MCP server is running on the same machine as the Claude client.

Point `command` to the `python` in your `.venv`. On powershell you get the python path using command `(Get-Command python).Path`, assuming your `.venv` is active.
Point `args` to the absolute path of the `main.py` file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hotel-booking-mcp": {
      "command": "<absolute path>\\HotelBookingMcp\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": [
        "<absolute path>\\HotelBookingMcp\\main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<hr />

### ⚠️ However, it's very unlikely that your MCP server and MCP client will run on the same host.

You will ideally have the MCP server running on a different host across the network.

Therefore, let's change `mcp.run(transport="stdio")` in `main.py` to `mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")`.

This indicates that your Claude Desktop App now needs to configure a remote MCP server over HTTP, that is running somewhere accross the internet.

*Here the MCP server will still run on 127.0.0.1, but you have remote server you can deploy it there and try with the remote IP address.*

After making the change in `main.py`, start the MCP server as:

```powershell
uv run .\main.py

INFO:     Started server process [15164]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO      StreamableHTTP session manager started  
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
...

```

### ✅ Claude config for `streamable-http` to connect with remote MCP server

As explained, this is the configuration you need when the MCP server is running on a remote system across the network.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hotel-booking-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

⚠️ After config changes, exit the Claude desktop app from `File` ➡️ `Exit` and start it again.

Either way, now when you ask Claude question about the hotel, it will use one of the MCP tools to find and provide an answer.

Now I'm asking about the hotel. Note the list of MCP tools available to Claude desktop app now:

<img src="/assets/claude-mcp-1.jpg" width="100%"> <br />

Note for each answer, the app is showing which tool it used to figure out the answer, based on the docstring we wrote earlier.

Then asking about list of available rooms:

<img src="/assets/claude-mcp-2.jpg" width="100%"> <br />

Asking about amenities and booking a suite room:

<img src="/assets/claude-mcp-3.jpg" width="100%"> <br />
<img src="/assets/claude-mcp-4.jpg" width="100%"> <br />
<img src="/assets/claude-mcp-5.jpg" width="100%"> <br />

Next time when I ask for available rooms, the booked room 301 is excluded.

<img src="/assets/claude-mcp-6.jpg" width="100%"> <br />

<br />
<br />
