You've come to the right website. Just keep reading. <br />
I am posting content here that will help you learn about Generative AI, building agentic systems and software engineering in general.
<br />
<br />
But before you proceed, you need to remember..

Crafting agentic software depends mainly on five maturity areas
<br />
<br />
✅ Understanding the problem statement<br />
✅ Creating agent personas with clear objectives<br />
✅ Writing clear yet clever prompts<br />
✅ Developing simple and effective software<br />
✅ Owning what you build (You build it, you run it)
<br />
