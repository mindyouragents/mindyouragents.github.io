<span class="important">Building agentic software?</span>
<br />
<br />

Keep reading...
I am posting content here that will help you learn about Generative AI, agentic AI and software engineering in general.
But before you proceed, you need to remember..
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Machines don't learn or think like humans do! It's all math.</span><a href="/2025/04/02/is-ml-really-making-machines-intelligent/">Know more...</a>
<br />
<br />

In my opinion, crafting agentic software depends mainly on five maturity areas...
<br />
<br />
1️⃣ Understanding the problem statement and how agents can help<br />
2️⃣ Creating required agent personas with clear objectives<br />
3️⃣ <a href="/2025/04/26/llms-and-bayes-theorem/">Write clever prompts</a> using <a href="/2025/06/22/prompt-engineering/">prompt engineering techniques</a><br />
4️⃣ Developing simple and effective agentic workflows<br />
5️⃣ Retrospect, and own what you build (You build it, you run it)
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">To build your (or your team's) capabilities in Generative and agentic AI, first you need to follow this three step process.</span>
<br />
<br />
I followed this three step process myself.
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Step 1</span>
<br />
<br />
✅ Stop thinking that AI is the answer to all your problems<br />
✅ Be part of, or develop an excellent engineering culture<br />
✅ Collaborate, experiment and learn; understand what others are doing<br />
✅ Move from jargon-driven development to value-driven development<br />
✅ Learn Python, async programming, API development and one database
<br/>

<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Step 2</span>
<br />
<br />
✅ Start small; build a simple chatbot and experiment with prompts<br />
✅ Learn vector databases, text embedding, chunks, etc<br />
✅ Build a RAG workflow, connect it with the chatbot, add memory<br />
✅ Learn different RAG techniques and tool usage with LLMs<br />
✅ Understand the economics of cloud computing<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Step 3</span>
<br />
<br />
✅ Build a system with two agents that interact with each other<br />
✅ Learn structured output and guardrails<br />
✅ Learn agentic workflow patterns and orchestration<br />
✅ Add more agents and experiment; and learn <a href="#">Model Context Protocol</a><br />
✅ Finally, learn logging, monitoring, LLMOps and deployment<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Btw, did you look at your data?</span> 
<br />
<br />
Your AI superpowers are only as good as your data is. Most enterprises have data that is highly unorganized and a mess.
